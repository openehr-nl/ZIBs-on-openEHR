The following text is copied from the Dutch ZIB model AbilityToPerformNursingActivities-v1.0:

When taking care of a patient with a disease or disability, parents, children and other caretakers often carry out nursing interventions. Adults and older children may carry out nursing interventions by themselves. Therefore skills training is needed for caregivers/ children. Qualification is required for correct performing of an intervention and also knowledge about what to do in case of complications.
The assessment of the degree to which the intervention can be performed independently refers only to the indicated intervention.


Information about the qualification of skill for performing a specific nursing intervention is necessary to provide parents, children and other caregivers appropriate support for the care of the patient.

In order to indicate to whom the defined skills relate, use is made of one of the implicit concepts of the information model: the subject of the data. Usually, this is the patient in which case it will not be explicitly mentioned. If the data relates to a different person, this can be indicated by means of a reference to e.g. the information model Contactperson.">
