The following text is copied from the Dutch ZIB model AbilityToGroome-v1.0:

Managing one's own medication is part of self-healthcare. Limitations in this ability indicate a reduced ability to cope for oneself.
This activity and activities such as those including cooking, using the telephone and shopping are also known as instrumentel activities of daily living (IADL). These tasks support an independent life style. Many people can still live independently even though they need help with one or two of these IADL’s.

To promote safe and proper use of medication, it is important in patient care to know whether the patient is capable of using the medication independently, or if the patient needs help doing so.">
