This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam or ACTION.procedure archetype, but can also be used within other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical measurements or test results - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.head_circumference or OBSERVATION.glasgow_coma_scale.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom_sign.">
